We are two students who have noticed a need for a clean  and modern solution for playing bridge online that is fun, easy and engaging. Since 2020 we have developed the online platform Bridgestars which focuses on the educational aspects of bridge. Brigestars let students from Swedish bridge schools improve their skills by taking part in different courses available on the platform. Our vision is to provide an engaging learning environment for all bridge students, wether you're a beginner or an experienced player. ",
