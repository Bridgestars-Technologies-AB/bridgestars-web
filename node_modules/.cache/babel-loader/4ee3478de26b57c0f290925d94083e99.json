People are so scared to\n                  lose that they don&apos;t even try. Like, one thing people can&apos;t say is that\n                  I&apos;m not trying, and I&apos;m not trying my hardest, and I&apos;m not trying\n                  to do the best way I know how.\n                </FaqCollapse>\n                <FaqCollapse\n                  title=\"Where do I find the shipping details?\"\n                  open={collapse === 5}\n                  onClick={() => (collapse === 5 ? setCollapse(false) : setCollapse(5))}\n                >\n                  There&apos;s nothing I really wanted to do in life that I wasn&apos;t able to get\n                  good at. That&apos;s my skill. I&apos;m not really specifically talented at\n                  anything except for the ability to learn. That&apos;s what I do. That&apos;s what\n                  I&apos;m here for. Don&apos;t be afraid to be wrong because you can&apos;t learn\n                  anything from a compliment. I always felt like I could do anything. That&apos;s\n                  the main thing people are controlled by! Thoughts- their perception of themselves!\n                  They&apos;re slowed down by their perception of themselves. If you&apos;re taught\n                  you can&apos;t do anything, you won&apos;t do anything. I was taught I could do\n                  everything.\n                </FaqCollapse>\n              </MKBox>\n            </Card>\n          </Grid>\n        </Grid>\n      </Container>\n    </MKBox>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Faq;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
