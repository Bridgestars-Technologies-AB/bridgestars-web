I always felt like I could do\n              anything. That&apos;s the main thing people are controlled by!\n              Thoughts- their perception of themselves! They&apos;re slowed down\n              by their perception of themselves. If you&apos;re taught you\n              can&apos;t do anything, you won&apos;t do anything. I was taught I\n              could do everything.\n            </FaqCollapse>\n          </Grid>\n        </Grid>\n      </Container>\n    </MKBox>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Faq;\n","/*\n=========================================================\n* Otis Kit PRO - v2.0.0\n=========================================================\n\n* Product Page: https://material-ui.com/store/items/otis-kit-pro-material-kit-react/\n* Copyright 2022 Creative Tim (https://www.creative-tim.com)\n\nCoded by www.creative-tim.com\n\n =========================================================\n\n* The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n*/\n\n// @mui material components\nimport Container from '@mui/material/Container';\nimport Grid from '@mui/material/Grid';\nimport Switch from '@mui/material/Switch';\n\n// Otis Kit PRO components\nimport MKBox from 'components/MKBox';\nimport MKTypography from 'components/MKTypography';\nimport MKInput from 'components/MKInput';\nimport MKButton from 'components/MKButton';\n\nfunction Contact() {\n  return (\n    <MKBox\n      component='section'\n      display='grid'\n      position='relative'\n      minHeight='90vh'\n      borderRadius='xl'\n      mr={{ xs: 0, lg: -2 }}\n      mb={{ xs: 0, lg: -2 }}\n      sx={{ overflow: { xs: 'hidden', lg: 'visible' }, placeItems: 'center' }}\n    >\n      <MKBox\n        component='img'\n        alt='lake house'\n        src='https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1539803442075-48618f39bb3d?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;q=80'\n        width={{ xs: '100%', lg: '50%' }}\n        height={{ xs: '100%', lg: '100%' }}\n        position='absolute'\n        right={0}\n        bottom={{ xs: '-25%', lg: 'unset' }}\n        top={{ xs: 0, lg: 'unset' }}\n        sx={{\n          objectFit: 'cover',\n          borderTopLeftRadius: ({ borders: { borderRadius } }) => ({\n            xs: 0,\n            lg: borderRadius.lg,\n          }),\n        }}\n      />\n      <Container>\n        <Grid\n          container\n          spacing={{ xs: 0, lg: 3 }}\n          sx={{ mt: { xs: 0, lg: 12 } }}\n        >\n          <Grid\n            item\n            xs={12}\n            lg={7}\n            justifyContent='center'\n            flexDirection='column'\n          >\n            <MKBox\n              display='flex'\n              justifyContent='center'\n              alignItems='center'\n              flexDirection='column'\n              shadow='lg'\n              borderRadius='xl'\n              sx={{\n                backgroundColor: ({\n                  functions: { rgba },\n                  palette: { white },\n                }) => rgba(white.main, 0.8),\n                backdropFilter: 'saturate(200%) blur(30px)',\n                px: { xs: 3, sm: 6 },\n                py: { xs: 3, sm: 8 },\n                mb: { xs: 0, lg: 8 },\n                mt: { xs: 0, lg: -6 },\n              }}\n            >\n              <MKTypography variant='h3' textAlign='center' mb={2}>\n                Contact us\n              </MKTypography>\n              <MKBox component='form' method='post' autoComplete='off'>\n                <MKBox py={3} px={{ xs: 3, md: 12, lg: 6, xl: 12 }}>\n                  <Grid container spacing={3} sx={{ mb: 3 }}>\n                    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} lg={12} xl={6}>\n                      <MKInput\n                        variant='standard'\n                        placeholder='eg.
