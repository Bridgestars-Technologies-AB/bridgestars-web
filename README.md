# bridgestars-web

`folder: nuxt, branch: main` - this is the new website built with vue3 and nuxt3

`folder: old_react, branch: prod` - this is the old website currently on production

`folder: new_react_castor` - this is a mockup of the dashboard for reference



The new website is automatically pushed to theolundqvist/bridgestars-helper-repo on a push to main. This notifies vercel that then creates a new build and publishes the site to https://bridgestars-web-test.vercel.app
